map
  make map clickable
  change map marker

my trips page
  reservation.listing not rendering ... why 
  reservations come from backend in current vs past (two arrays in one object)
    reservations: {current: [{reservation}, {reservation}], past: [{reservation}]}
  
reservation update
  new form for reservation update
  updates and takes you back to your trip page 

reservation delete  
  confirmation modal
  deletes and takes you back to your trips page

reservation dates
  get reservations by listing - on listing show page to amend calendar view ???

Misc
  update listings location coordinates via CLI



Priority 1:
just the error if you try to book a reservation overlap
Get all functionality CRUD reservations
flow through all pages 


Post Green Lit:
calendar date overlap
maps marker



update listing locations via CLI
/ reseed

when you make a reservation, and try to go to mytrips, you have to refresh for it to pull properly
(maybe bc of the new listings store)
