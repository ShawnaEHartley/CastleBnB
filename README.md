## About the Site
This web app allows users to create an account, find and book unique accomodations in various locations around Westeros.
Similar to a bed and breakfast, hosts can rent out spare rooms, private or shared, or entire places for users to stay. Guests search for avaiable listings and book a place to stay for a night, a week, or longer. This is a popular alternative to traditional hotels and provides a more unique accomodation experience to guests while providing property owners the opportunity to earn extra income on a flexible basis.
